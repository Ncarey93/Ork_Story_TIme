We was on some humie world, don’t remember da name, don’t care neither. All I know is we landed, and dere was plenty of stuff to krump. Da Warboss, Big Snagga, yelled out, “WAAAGH!” and we all charged outta da drop pods.
                
Dem humies had all sorts of shiny guns and tanks, but dey didn’t stand a chance. We tore through dere lines like a squig through a grot. 
I was choppin’ and stompin’, me power klaw rippin’ through armor like paper. 
Den I sees it – a big, stompy dreadnought, all guns and metal fists. It looked dead killy, and I knew I had to fight it.
                
I charged, bellowin’ a proper Orky roar. Da dreadnought swung at me, but I was too quick. 
I ducked, jammed me klaw into its leg, and pulled. Metal screeched, and da dreadnought toppled. 
I jumped on its back, poundin’ away with me choppas until it stopped movin’.
                
Da boyz were all cheerin’, and I felt dead proud. But da fight wasn’t over. 
More humies were comin’, and Big Snagga was yellin’ for us to keep krumpin’. We fought all day and night, smashin’ and bashin’ until dere wasn’t a humie left standin’.

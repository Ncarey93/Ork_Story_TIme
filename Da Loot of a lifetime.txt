We was fightin’ on some backwater planet, right? Da humies had dis massive fortress, all shiny and full of teef and guns. 
                Da Warboss, Big Snagga, says to me, “Gorkdakka, you get in dere and bring back da best loot you can find.”
                
                So, I rounds up me best boyz, and we sneak – well, more like stomp – our way to da fortress. We gets inside, and it’s a right maze. But we ain’t dumb.
                 We follow da smell of fuel and gunpowder, and dere it is – a room full of crates, stacked high with all sorts of good stuff.
                
                I opens da first crate, and me jaw drops. It’s full of power klaws, big ‘uns, with extra choppiness. 
                I knew I had to have one. But den I see it – a big, shiny gun, bigger dan any I ever seen. I grabs it, and it feels just right in me hands. 
                I calls it “Da Deffbringa.”
                
                We loads up, takin’ as much as we can carry, and makes our way back to Big Snagga. 
                He takes one look at Da Deffbringa and laughs. “Gorkdakka,” he says, “you done good. Dat’s a proper Orky gun.”
                
                Since den, I been known as Gorkdakka Da Lootmaster, and Da Deffbringa’s saved me hide more times dan I can count. 
                Ain’t no one messes with an Ork with a gun like dis!

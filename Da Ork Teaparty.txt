Oi, you’re not gonna believe dis, but it’s true. I’m Dim'ed, and dis is da tale of da strangest day in me Orky life: da day we had a teaparty.

It started when da Warboss, Big Snagga, got a funny idea in his head. We was on a planet we called Teefmoon, named for da rich veins of shiny minerals perfect for makin’ teef. We was fightin’ da humies, as usual, when Big Snagga saw dis fancy humie general, all dressed up in gold and frills, havin’ a teaparty right in da middle of a battlefield.

Big Snagga laughed so hard, he almost fell over. “Oi, boyz,” he says, “we gotta try dis teaparty thing! It’ll be a right laugh!”              
So, after we finished krumpin’ da humies, Big Snagga ordered us to set up our own teaparty. We looted da humie camp for teapots, cups, and even a big table with fancy cloth. Da boyz were confused, but when Big Snagga gives an order, we follow it.
We set everythin’ up, with Big Snagga sittin’ at da head of da table. He put on da humie general’s hat, which looked ridiculous on his big green head. “Right,” he says, “let’s ‘ave some tea!”
                
Da teapots were filled with squig juice – proper Orky drink. We poured it into da tiny cups, which were way too small for our big hands, and tried to act like humies, holdin’ our pinkies out and all. Da boyz were laughin’ and jokin’, spillin’ more squig juice than we drank.
                
Den, just as we was gettin’ into it, more humies showed up, seein’ us havin’ our teaparty. Dey must’ve thought we was mockin’ ‘em (which we was), and dey charged at us, guns blazin’. Big Snagga roared, “Dis teaparty’s over, boyz! Time to krump!”
                
We dropped our tiny cups and grabbed our choppas. Da humies didn’t stand a chance. We fought ‘em off, laughin’ and shoutin’. By da end of it, da battlefield was a mess of broken teapots, spilled squig juice, and humie bodies.
                
Big Snagga, still wearin’ da humie general’s hat, looked around and said, “Dat was da best teaparty ever! We gotta do dis again sometime.”
                
Since den, every now and again, we have ourselves an Orky teaparty, just for da fun of it. It’s a good way to blow off steam before a big scrap. And if any humies show up, well, it just makes it all da more fun!
                
So, if ya ever hear about Orks havin’ a teaparty, believe it. It’s da truth, and it’s a right good time. WAAAGH!

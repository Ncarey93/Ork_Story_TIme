We was on dis jungle world, right, lookin’ for somethin’ to krump. Da Warboss, Big Snagga, says dere’s Eldar about, so we goes lookin’. 
                We finds ‘em, all sneaky-like in dere fancy armor. We start fightin’, but den dis Wierdboy shows up, all glowin’ and mutterin’.
                
                I ain’t afraid of no Wierdboy, so I charges at him. But he waves his hands, and dere’s this big flash. 
                Next thing I know, I’m seein’ things. Strange things. 
                Visions of squigs with humie heads and gretchin dancin’ in tutus. It was weird, I tell ya.
                
                But den, I gets an idea. If dis Wierdboy’s messin’ with me head, maybe I can mess with his. 
                So I starts shoutin’, “WAAAGH!” real loud, tryin’ to drown out his mutterin’. It works. 
                He looks confused, and I takes me chance. I swings me choppa, and down he goes.
                
                Da visions stop, and I feel normal again. Da boyz are lookin’ at me funny, but I tells ‘em, “Ain’t nothin’ a good choppa can’t fix!”
                
                Since den, I been wary of Wierdboyz, but I ain’t afraid. If one of ‘em tries to zap me again, I’ll just krump ‘em harder. Dat’s da Orky way!
                
                An’ dat’s me tales, humie. Now get outta here before I gets bored and decides to krump ya!

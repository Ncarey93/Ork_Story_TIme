            <p id="Da Great Scrap" style = "display:none;">Oi, you listenin’? Good. I’m Gorkdakka, and dis 'ere's da story of da greatest scrap I ever had.

                We was on some humie world, don’t remember da name, don’t care neither. All I know is we landed, and dere was plenty of stuff to krump. Da Warboss, Big Snagga, yelled out, “WAAAGH!” and we all charged outta da drop pods.
                
                Dem humies had all sorts of shiny guns and tanks, but dey didn’t stand a chance. We tore through dere lines like a squig through a grot. 
                I was choppin’ and stompin’, me power klaw rippin’ through armor like paper. 
                Den I sees it – a big, stompy dreadnought, all guns and metal fists. It looked dead killy, and I knew I had to fight it.
                
                I charged, bellowin’ a proper Orky roar. Da dreadnought swung at me, but I was too quick. 
                I ducked, jammed me klaw into its leg, and pulled. Metal screeched, and da dreadnought toppled. 
                I jumped on its back, poundin’ away with me choppas until it stopped movin’.
                
                Da boyz were all cheerin’, and I felt dead proud. But da fight wasn’t over. 
                More humies were comin’, and Big Snagga was yellin’ for us to keep krumpin’. We fought all day and night, smashin’ and bashin’ until dere wasn’t a humie left standin’.</p>

            <p id="Da Loot of a Lifetime" style = "display:none;">Oi, dis one’s a good un. I’m Hob'iz, and dis is da tale of da biggest loot I ever nabbed.

                We was fightin’ on some backwater planet, right? Da humies had dis massive fortress, all shiny and full of teef and guns. 
                Da Warboss, Big Snagga, says to me, “Gorkdakka, you get in dere and bring back da best loot you can find.”
                
                So, I rounds up me best boyz, and we sneak – well, more like stomp – our way to da fortress. We gets inside, and it’s a right maze. But we ain’t dumb.
                 We follow da smell of fuel and gunpowder, and dere it is – a room full of crates, stacked high with all sorts of good stuff.
                
                I opens da first crate, and me jaw drops. It’s full of power klaws, big ‘uns, with extra choppiness. 
                I knew I had to have one. But den I see it – a big, shiny gun, bigger dan any I ever seen. I grabs it, and it feels just right in me hands. 
                I calls it “Da Deffbringa.”
                
                We loads up, takin’ as much as we can carry, and makes our way back to Big Snagga. 
                He takes one look at Da Deffbringa and laughs. “Gorkdakka,” he says, “you done good. Dat’s a proper Orky gun.”
                
                Since den, I been known as Gorkdakka Da Lootmaster, and Da Deffbringa’s saved me hide more times dan I can count. 
                Ain’t no one messes with an Ork with a gun like dis!</p>

            <p id="Da Wierdboy`s Curse" style = "display:none;">Right, dis one’s a bit strange. I’m Mordaka, and dis is da story of da time I got zapped by a Wierdboy.

                We was on dis jungle world, right, lookin’ for somethin’ to krump. Da Warboss, Big Snagga, says dere’s Eldar about, so we goes lookin’. 
                We finds ‘em, all sneaky-like in dere fancy armor. We start fightin’, but den dis Wierdboy shows up, all glowin’ and mutterin’.
                
                I ain’t afraid of no Wierdboy, so I charges at him. But he waves his hands, and dere’s this big flash. 
                Next thing I know, I’m seein’ things. Strange things. 
                Visions of squigs with humie heads and gretchin dancin’ in tutus. It was weird, I tell ya.
                
                But den, I gets an idea. If dis Wierdboy’s messin’ with me head, maybe I can mess with his. 
                So I starts shoutin’, “WAAAGH!” real loud, tryin’ to drown out his mutterin’. It works. 
                He looks confused, and I takes me chance. I swings me choppa, and down he goes.
                
                Da visions stop, and I feel normal again. Da boyz are lookin’ at me funny, but I tells ‘em, “Ain’t nothin’ a good choppa can’t fix!”
                
                Since den, I been wary of Wierdboyz, but I ain’t afraid. If one of ‘em tries to zap me again, I’ll just krump ‘em harder. Dat’s da Orky way!
                
                An’ dat’s me tales, humie. Now get outta here before I gets bored and decides to krump ya!</p>

            <p id="Da Stompa's Revenge" style = "display:none;">Oi, you lot, listen up, ‘cause dis stori is almost as good as Dakka! I’m Kilgran, and dis is da story of how we took back our Stompa from dem sneaky Eldar.

                We was camped on a scrapworld, gatherin’ bits and pieces to make our meks happy. Den, outta nowhere, dem Eldar show up, all swift and shiny, and steal our pride and joy: da biggest, baddest Stompa we ever built. Da Warboss, Big Snagga, was furious! He roared, “We ain’t lettin’ no pointy-ears steal from us! WAAAGH!”
                
                So, we mounted up and gave chase. Took us a few days, but we tracked ‘em to dis desert planet, all dunes and sandstorms. Da boyz were ready for a proper scrap, and we knew we had to be sneaky – well, as sneaky as Orks can be. We waited till night, when da Eldar were probably nappin’ or doin’ weird Eldar stuff.
                
                We crept through da sand, and dere it was – our Stompa, guarded by a handful of Eldar. I looked at Big Snagga, and he nodded. We charged, yellin’ “WAAAGH!” like madboyz. Da Eldar were quick, but dey weren’t ready for a full-on Ork assault. We smashed through dere lines, choppas flashin’ in da moonlight.
                
                I made straight for da Stompa, climbin’ up da side and bashin’ any Eldar in my way. Inside, dere was dis fancy Eldar boss tryin’ to figure out da controls. I laughed, swingin’ me choppa. He dodged, but not quick enough. I got ‘im right in da side, and down he went.
                
                With da Eldar boss outta da way, I yelled for me boyz. We piled into da Stompa, kickin’ out any Eldar still inside. Big Snagga took da controls, laughin’ like a loon. “Dis is ours again, boyz! Let’s show ‘em what a real fight looks like!”
                
                We powered up da Stompa, and it roared to life. Da Eldar outside looked terrified as we stomped and blasted our way through dere camp. Nothin’ could stop us! By dawn, dere wasn’t an Eldar left in sight. We had our Stompa back, and da desert was littered with bits of Eldar tech and bodies.
                
                Big Snagga was so pleased, he declared a feast. We ate, drank, and told tales of our victory till da sun went down. And from dat day on, da Stompa was known as “Revenge,” a reminder dat no one messes with Orks and gets away with it.
                
                So remember, humie, if ya see a Stompa comin’ your way, best start runnin’, ‘cause it might just be us, lookin’ for more loot and more fightin’! WAAAGH!</p>

            <p id="Da Ork Teaparty" style = "display:none;">

                Oi, you’re not gonna believe dis, but it’s true. I’m Dim'ed, and dis is da tale of da strangest day in me Orky life: da day we had a teaparty.

                It started when da Warboss, Big Snagga, got a funny idea in his head. We was on a planet we called Teefmoon, named for da rich veins of shiny minerals perfect for makin’ teef. We was fightin’ da humies, as usual, when Big Snagga saw dis fancy humie general, all dressed up in gold and frills, havin’ a teaparty right in da middle of a battlefield.
                
                Big Snagga laughed so hard, he almost fell over. “Oi, boyz,” he says, “we gotta try dis teaparty thing! It’ll be a right laugh!”
                
                So, after we finished krumpin’ da humies, Big Snagga ordered us to set up our own teaparty. We looted da humie camp for teapots, cups, and even a big table with fancy cloth. Da boyz were confused, but when Big Snagga gives an order, we follow it.
                
                We set everythin’ up, with Big Snagga sittin’ at da head of da table. He put on da humie general’s hat, which looked ridiculous on his big green head. “Right,” he says, “let’s ‘ave some tea!”
                
                Da teapots were filled with squig juice – proper Orky drink. We poured it into da tiny cups, which were way too small for our big hands, and tried to act like humies, holdin’ our pinkies out and all. Da boyz were laughin’ and jokin’, spillin’ more squig juice than we drank.
                
                Den, just as we was gettin’ into it, more humies showed up, seein’ us havin’ our teaparty. Dey must’ve thought we was mockin’ ‘em (which we was), and dey charged at us, guns blazin’. Big Snagga roared, “Dis teaparty’s over, boyz! Time to krump!”
                
                We dropped our tiny cups and grabbed our choppas. Da humies didn’t stand a chance. We fought ‘em off, laughin’ and shoutin’. By da end of it, da battlefield was a mess of broken teapots, spilled squig juice, and humie bodies.
                
                Big Snagga, still wearin’ da humie general’s hat, looked around and said, “Dat was da best teaparty ever! We gotta do dis again sometime.”
                
                Since den, every now and again, we have ourselves an Orky teaparty, just for da fun of it. It’s a good way to blow off steam before a big scrap. And if any humies show up, well, it just makes it all da more fun!
                
                So, if ya ever hear about Orks havin’ a teaparty, believe it. It’s da truth, and it’s a right good time. WAAAGH!
